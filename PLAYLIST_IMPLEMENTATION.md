# 🎉 Playlist Management Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

The complete **Playlist Management feature** has been successfully implemented for the OpenMusic API with full CRUD operations, JWT authentication, and owner-based authorization.

---

## 📦 What Was Implemented

### **1. Database Migrations**

#### **playlists Table**
- `id` (VARCHAR(50), PRIMARY KEY)
- `name` (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- `owner` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL, FK to users.id)
- **CASCADE DELETE** when user is deleted

#### **playlist_songs Table**
- `id` (VARCHAR(50), PRIMARY KEY)
- `playlist_id` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL, FK to playlists.id)
- `song_id` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL, FK to songs.id)
- **UNIQUE constraint** on (playlist_id, song_id) - prevents duplicates
- **CASCADE DELETE** when playlist or song is deleted

---

### **2. Exception Classes**

✅ `AuthorizationError.js` - 403 Forbidden error for unauthorized access

---

### **3. Services**

✅ **PlaylistsService.js** - Complete business logic:
- `addPlaylist(name, owner)` - Create new playlist
- `getPlaylists(owner)` - Get user's playlists
- `deletePlaylistById(id)` - Delete playlist
- `verifyPlaylistOwner(id, owner)` - Authorization check
- `addSongToPlaylist(playlistId, songId)` - Add song
- `getSongsFromPlaylist(playlistId)` - Get playlist songs
- `getPlaylistById(id)` - Get playlist details
- `deleteSongFromPlaylist(playlistId, songId)` - Remove song

---

### **4. Validators**

✅ **playlists.js** - Payload validation:
- `validatePlaylistPayload()` - Validate playlist name
- `validatePlaylistSongPayload()` - Validate songId

---

### **5. Handlers**

✅ **PlaylistsHandler.js** - Request handlers:
- `postPlaylistHandler` - Create playlist
- `getPlaylistsHandler` - Get user's playlists
- `deletePlaylistByIdHandler` - Delete playlist (with authorization)
- `postSongToPlaylistHandler` - Add song (with authorization & validation)
- `getSongsFromPlaylistHandler` - Get songs (with authorization)
- `deleteSongFromPlaylistHandler` - Remove song (with authorization)

---

### **6. Routes**

✅ **routes.js** - All routes protected with JWT:
- `POST /playlists` - Create playlist
- `GET /playlists` - Get user's playlists
- `DELETE /playlists/{id}` - Delete playlist
- `POST /playlists/{id}/songs` - Add song
- `GET /playlists/{id}/songs` - Get playlist songs
- `DELETE /playlists/{id}/songs` - Remove song

**All routes require `auth: 'openmusic_jwt'`**

---

### **7. Documentation**

✅ **PLAYLISTS.md** - Complete API documentation with:
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Authorization rules
- Database schema
- Usage examples
- Security features
- cURL examples

---

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

✅ **JWT Authentication Required** - All endpoints require valid access token  
✅ **Owner Verification** - Only playlist owner can modify/view  
✅ **Song Validation** - Checks if song exists before adding  
✅ **Duplicate Prevention** - Database constraint prevents duplicate songs  
✅ **Cascade Delete** - Automatic cleanup on user/playlist/song deletion  
✅ **Authorization Error** - 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access  
✅ **Not Found Error** - 404 when playlist/song doesn't exist  

---

## 📊 API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/playlists` | ✅ JWT | Create playlist |
| GET | `/playlists` | ✅ JWT | Get user's playlists |
| DELETE | `/playlists/{id}` | ✅ JWT | Delete playlist (owner) |
| POST | `/playlists/{id}/songs` | ✅ JWT | Add song (owner) |
| GET | `/playlists/{id}/songs` | ✅ JWT | Get songs (owner) |
| DELETE | `/playlists/{id}/songs` | ✅ JWT | Remove song (owner) |

## 🎯 Authorization Flow

### **1. Create Playlist**
```
User (JWT) → Handler → Service → Database
↓
User becomes owner automatically
```

### **2. Access Playlist (View/Modify)**
```
User (JWT) → Handler → verifyPlaylistOwner() → Check owner
↓
If owner matches: ✅ Allow
If owner doesn't match: ❌ 403 Forbidden
```

### **3. Add Song to Playlist**
```
User (JWT) → Handler → verifyPlaylistOwner() → Check owner
↓
Validate songId exists (via SongsService)
↓
Add to playlist_songs table
```

### **4. Delete Playlist**
```
User (JWT) → Handler → verifyPlaylistOwner() → Check owner
↓
Delete playlist (cascade deletes all songs in it)
```

---

## 🗂️ Database Relationships

```
users (id)
  ↓ (owner FK)
playlists (id, name, owner)
  ↓ (playlist_id FK)
playlist_songs (id, playlist_id, song_id)
  ↓ (song_id FK)
songs (id, title, performer)
```

**Foreign Key Constraints:**
- `playlists.owner` → `users.id` (CASCADE DELETE)
- `playlist_songs.playlist_id` → `playlists.id` (CASCADE DELETE)
- `playlist_songs.song_id` → `songs.id` (CASCADE DELETE)

## 🚀 Testing the Implementation

### **1. Register and Login**
```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"johndoe","password":"secret","fullname":"John Doe"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/authentications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"johndoe","password":"secret"}'
```

### **2. Create Playlist**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/playlists \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"My Favorites"}'
```

### **3. Add Song to Playlist**
```bash
# First create a song (or use existing)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/songs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title":"Bohemian Rhapsody",
    "year":1975,
    "genre":"Rock",
    "performer":"Queen"
  }'

# Add song to playlist
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/playlists/PLAYLIST_ID/songs \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"songId":"SONG_ID"}'
```

### **4. View Playlist Songs**

curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/playlists/PLAYLIST_ID/songs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

### **1. Service Layer Integration**
- **PlaylistsService** handles all database operations
- **SongsService** used for song validation
- **UsersService** provides username for playlist display

### **2. Authorization Pattern**
```javascript
// In every handler that modifies/views playlist:
await this._playlistsService.verifyPlaylistOwner(playlistId, userId);

// verifyPlaylistOwner() throws:
// - NotFoundError (404) if playlist doesn't exist
// - AuthorizationError (403) if user is not owner
```

### **3. JWT Integration**
```javascript
// In routes.js:
options: {
  auth: 'openmusic_jwt',
}

// In handler:
const { userId } = request.auth.credentials;
```

### **4. Data Validation**
```javascript
// Validate playlist name
PlaylistsValidator.validatePlaylistPayload(request.payload);

// Validate songId
PlaylistsValidator.validatePlaylistSongPayload(request.payload);

// Validate song exists
await this._songsService.getSongById(songId);
```
